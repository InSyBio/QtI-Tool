Example Dataset can be downloaded directly from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oVForrpsdxp_Fe593oU9JdH6PyZ2N02O?usp=sharing

It consists of two experiments with three technical replicates (6 files in total) from the CSF-Ecoli dataset described in the paper:
Corthesy J., et al.,An adaptive pipeline to maximize isobaric tagging data in large-scale MS-based proteomics, Journal of Proteome Research, Accepted on April 2018, In Print.

The files are in .mzML format so that no further software is required for their transformation.

These files should be plased in a folder in the directory where the code will run.
