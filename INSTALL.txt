		c.	Place within the fasta folder of this project the .pro files included in InSyBio codes and files folder
		d.	From the subfolder bin within the folder tandem-linux-15-04-01-1 copy the tandem.exe file and place it in the code_folder
		e.	From the command line go to the InSyBio_code_folder and execute the following command with sudo rights: chmod a+x tandem.exe
		f.	Check if xTandem is working by  running the ./xtandem.exe input.xml command using command line being in the code_folder
	5.	Create the following folders within the InSyBio_code_folder: filtered_files, xtandem_input, xtandem_output.
